Headhunter is an HTML and CSS validation tool that injects itself into your Rails feature tests and automagically checks all your generated HTML and CSS for validity.

In addition, it also looks out for unused (and therefore superfluous) CSS selectors.

## How to use

Add Headhunter to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'headhunter'
end
```

Just set the environment variable `HEADHUNTER` to `true` when running your tests, e.g.:

- `rake HEADHUNTER=true`
- `rspec HEADHUNTER=true`
- `cucumber HEADHUNTER=true`

Headhunter doesn't keep your tests from passing if invalid HTML or unused CSS is found. Instead it displays a short statistic after the tests are run.

    $ rake HEADHUNTER=true

    Precompiling assets for Headhunter... done!

    Found 23 CSS selectors.
    20 selectors are in use.
    3 selectors are not in use: a img, #flash.failure, input[type='file']

## How it works

Headhunter registers itself as middleware in the Rack stack and triggers validation for every HTML response. Headhunter also iterates over every `.css` file and triggers its validation. In addition, it checks which CSS selectors are really used in the HTML pages to see whether there exist any unused CSS definitions.

For being able to validate CSS, `rake assets:precompile` is triggered at the beginning of running tests. This may slow down starting your tests a bit. **Notice: all precompiled assets will be removed after the tests have finished!**

## Requirements

### Tidy HTML

[Tidy HTML](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) should be installed on a typical OSX and Linux installation already. You're not developing on a Windows machine, are you?!

If you want to validate HTML5 (and you should want to!), install the HTML5 version like described here: [homebrew tidy html5](http://techblog.willshouse.com/2013/10/21/homebrew-tidy-html5/).

### Working internet connection

You need a working internet connection to run CSS validation. As a Rails application typically contains one single CSS file (`application.css`), this won't have much impact on the speed of your tests.

## Known issues and future plans

- It would be nice to use Rails' own assets compilation that's executed when the first JavaScript test is run. Anyone has an idea on how to do this?
- At the moment, in addition to precompiling and removing your assets, `rake assets:clobber` is run also **before** precompiling! The issue is explained here: [Rake assets are generated twice when precompiling them once from command line and once from within a Ruby script](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20938891/rake-assets-are-generated-twice-when-precompiling-them-once-from-command-line-an)
- Instead of running `rake assets:clobber`, it may be also sufficient to simply remove all *.css files from `public/assets/stylesheets` manually. This would save some compilation time.
- Instead of using the online CSS validation service of ???, it would be nice to have a local CSS validator. Is there anything like this? TotalValidator seems to be able to do something like this, but it's not free for CSS validation and I don't know how to use it.
- HTML and CSS sources should not be compressed, to allow more concise error messages
- Would be really useful to have the concrete URL of every validated HTML page. But can't find a way to extract it from Rack response.
- There are not tests yet. I first want to see whether this gem would be appreciated by the community, and if so, I will definitely add tests.
- Didn't try this with AJAX requests yet. Would be great if such responses would be validated, too!

## Disclaimer

Headhunter is heavily inspired by Aanand Prasad's (outdated) [Deadweight](https://github.com/aanand/deadweight) gem and by Unboxed Consulting's [be_valid_asset](https://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset) gem. Thank you for your pioneering work!
